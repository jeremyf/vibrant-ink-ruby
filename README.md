# vibrant-ink-ruby-and-markdown theme

This is a Ruby-optimized version of [cherring/vibrant-ink](https://github.com/cherring/vibrant-ink) and [dfherr/vibrant-ink-ruby](https://github.com/dfherr/vibrant-ink-ruby/).

E.g. syntax highlighting for constants, class names and embedded variables in interpolated strings were added.

Note: The Markdown Highlighting screenshot includes [my personal adjustments](https://github.com/jeremyf/language-markdown) for the [`language-markdown` package](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown). My adjustments helped add context for Hugo parsing.
